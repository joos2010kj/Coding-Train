# Coding-Train-Programs

This REPO holds a bunch of programs I made with the assistance of Daniel Shiffman, the owner of Youtube channel "The Coding Train."

Title of each folder is written in the following format: <br />
A ( B ) <br />
where... <br />
- A: What the program is about
- B: Location of the Shiffman's Video that I received helped from or got inspired by 

*NOTE: CC is short for "Coding Challenge" and NOC is short for "Nature of Code"*

HUGE CREDITS TO DANIEL SHIFFMAN!
